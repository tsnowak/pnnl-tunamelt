
# Introduction

This repository is intended to be used to process `.mp4` files transcoded from `.ddf`s generated by a DIDSON acoustic camera. These videos contained a moving underwater turbine which conflated existing fish detectors.

# Setup

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fish_detection
python setup.py develop
```

# Intuition

The fish contained in these `.mp4`s are particularly difficult to see (detect). Looking at the original video, I'm not sure I personally catch all of them. Efforts are furthermore hindered by a significant amount of particulate matter in the water column. Nonetheless, these takeaways from watching the video guided the design of my video processing pipeline:

- processing does not need to occur live/in-situ
- consistently static objects can be removed


- SOMETHING BIOLOGICAL
- tortuousity (fish / non-linear movements)
- brightness
- false positives fine


- fourier transform pixels should be good
